Predicting Competitive Swimming Performance with Machine Learning
 Overview

This project explores the use of machine learning models to predict competitive swimming performance. The aim was to apply data science techniques to real-world sports analytics, supporting talent identification and performance improvement.

Regression models (XGBoost, Random Forest, MLP) predicted swim times with R² = 0.99

Classification models achieved 91% accuracy in grouping athletes by performance level

Unsupervised clustering (K-Means) segmented athletes to reveal hidden performance patterns

The project demonstrates how AI-driven insights can support coaches, athletes, and sports organizations in making data-informed decisions.
